**Probabilistic Movement Primitives** (ProMPs) offer a powerful framework for robot
skill learning by representing movements as distributions of trajectories.

In this this part of the library we use **neural network** to create Probabilistic Movement Primitives, thus the name Deep Pro MPs.

The main part is the class **DeepProMP** it implements the core training algorithmus. It used a DecoderDeepProPM and a EncoderDeepProMP.
